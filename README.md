# Work / Project Examples

##Sprout

https://sproutapp.io/

(the repo is private but I can source some sections of code if you would like)

The largest project that I have recently worked on was Sprout. I helped build the new Idea of what Sprout currently is, and engineered it from both a technical and business standpoint.

Sprout uses mobile users banking information to track users spending habits and provide analytics to businesses that they allow to obtain that data in order to create a passive income.

Businesses can offer cash incentives to users for spending at their store by x% of spend or $x for x amount spent at the store. Businesses can track their users and analytics through a dashboard provided to them.

My contributions to sprout on a programming aspect was that I built the entire backend. Sprout runs off of a RESTapi built in Laravel. I implemented various API’s such as Plaid, Stripe, Payment Rails, and Sendgrid.

I did other aspects as well as taking part in an accelerator to teach us about marketing and business tactics and presented out product to venture capitalists.

##Games

https://github.com/jwillz21/games

This project was just for me to practise with. The whole goal of this growing project is to continue familiarity with ember.js and test new concepts. So far it is only a tic-tac-toe game but I will be expanding it to more games such as connect 4 and battleship.

I made this project to implement and learn new algorithms (currently just Minimax) to solve problems and HTML5 Canvas to draw design using javascript.

This is a self created project that will grow over time.


##Bank-api

https://github.com/jwillz21/bank-api

This is another project that I am currently working on alone. It will end up being 1 of 3 projects that will make one running application. The whole purpose of this is to build a project using the experiences that I gained building sprouts backend and to practise frontend development and create a project I can use as an entry for a personal portfolio. It is still in its early stages and being worked on with the basic API nearly built.

It will contain
The API (laravel)
To serve balance, transaction, and income data.
A website (vue.js)
Display an online banking type of interface for users to check their banking activity.
A mobile app (React Native)
A mobile app version similar to the website.

#Inspiration

I love music, I love watching artists perform live. I have saw countless amounts of artists perform live from varying genres, but many of my music inspirations come from artists that are no longer alive.

In 2012 at Coachella Snoop Dogg performed and had a hologram of Tupac perform with him which I thought was amazing.

Recently I took a course on VR game development which gave me an idea. What if we could make a virtual concert that used neural network to predict the way an artist performed and created a virtual experience to enjoy seeing someone who you wouldn’t get to see otherwise.

Though this is an idea that would require a lot of time and research and skills I currently don’t have I thought I could maybe practise on smaller cases to start studying how this can be done.

I came across a few articles that could use different components that could be used to achieve something like this and see if it can be done. Here are the sources.

https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/12/12886698/machine-learning-video-image-prediction-mit
TL;DR a research team at MIT create an algorithm using neural networks that can predict 32 frames of video from an image. Videos are grainy and small, but can lead to so much more in the future.
https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3013676/researchers-make-a-fake-obama-video-using-a-neural-network
TL;DR researchers at University of Washington use machine learning to create a video of Obama lip syncing any audio they feed it.


This project inspires me because even if I don't have the processing power to do it yet or have the knowledge I figure I will learn alot along the journey of trying to build it, and I will probably start it once I finish the projects mentioned above.

#Focus

Given the time to focus on and build anything during my internship I would want to focus more on frontend web and mobile application development. Though my inspirational project is totally different from this, I would chose to focus my efforts on frontend to align with where I see the industry moving. Most of the jobs that I have come across here in calgary seem to be for fullstack and front nd developers so I would chose to focus on growing my skills in frontend development.


# Challenge - Sing-along

## The Task

1. Parse the provided String (`song`) and create an array with
   an entry for each line of the song.
   Eg: (`["Baby Shark doo doo doo doo doo doo", "Baby Shark!"]`)
2. Render each line of that array to the DOM as an `<li>`
   within the `#lyrics-list` unordered list.
3. Display each array item to the page sequentially, at
   1.5 second intervals
